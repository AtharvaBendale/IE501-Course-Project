# IE501-Course-Project
This is my repository for IE-501 (Optimization Models) course project under Prof. Avinash Bhardwaj in teams of 4.
The file "IE501 Assignment 2" contains my solutions for the second assignment and the file "longest_path.py" contains the code for finding the longest traversable path with no repeating edges.
